# Experimental characterizaton of a non-Markovian quantum process
We use machine learning techniques to estimate the temporal correlation in a non-Markovian quantum process. Here, I will give a brief motivation to our problem. For a detailed result, please have a look at our paper: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.104.022432.

Most noise-characterization methods for quantum technologies assume Markovianity, meaning that the environment and the system have no memory of their interactions with each other, because it is inefficient and computationally demanding to take temporal correlations into account. Here, we propose a more efficient machine learning method for estimating non- Markovian noise and implement it in a proof-of-principle quantum optics experiment.
