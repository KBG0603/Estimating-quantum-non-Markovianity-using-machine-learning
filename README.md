# Experimental characterizaton of a non-Markovian quantum process
We use machine learning techniques to estimate the temporal correlation in a non-Markovian quantum process. Here, I will give a brief motivation to our problem. For a detailed result, please have a look at our paper: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.104.022432.
